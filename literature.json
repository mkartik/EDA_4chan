The prophecies in Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22 describe a suffering Messiah who would be persecuted and killed, but the Jews chose to focus instead on those prophecies that discuss His glorious victories, not His crucifixion.<br><br>The commentaries in the Talmud, written before the onset of Christianity, clearly discuss the Messianic prophecies of Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22 and puzzle over how these would be fulfilled with the glorious setting up of the kingdom of the Messiah. After the church used these prophecies to prove the claims of Christ, the Jews took the position that the prophecies did not refer to the Messiah, but to Israel or some other person.<br><br>The Jews believed that the Messiah, the prophet which Moses spoke about, would come and deliver them from Roman bondage and set up a kingdom where they would be the rulers. Two of the disciples, James and John, even asked to sit at Jesus\u2019 right and left in His kingdom when He came into His glory. The people of Jerusalem also thought He would deliver them. They shouted praises to God for the mighty works they had seen Jesus do and called out, \u201cHosanna, save us,\u201d when He rode into Jerusalem on a donkey (Matthew 21:9). They treated Him like a conquering king. Then, when He allowed Himself to be arrested, tried, and crucified on a cursed cross, the people stopped believing that He was the promised prophet. They rejected their Messiah (Matthew 27:22).<br><br>Note that Paul tells the church that the spiritual blindness of Israel is a \u201cmystery\u201d that had not previously been revealed (Romans chapters 9\u201311). For thousands of years, Israel had been the one nation that looked to God while the Gentile nations generally rejected the light and chose to live in spiritual darkness. Israel and her inspired prophets revealed monotheism\u2014one God who was personally interested in mankind\u2019s destiny of heaven or hell, the path to salvation, the written Word with the Ten Commandments. Yet Israel rejected her prophesied Messiah, and the promises of the kingdom of heaven were postponed. A veil of spiritual blindness fell upon the eyes of the Jews, who previously were the most spiritually discerning people. As Paul explained, this hardening on the part of Israel led to the blessing of the Gentiles who would believe in Jesus and accept Him as Lord and Savior.", "time": 1589160870, "resto": 15327273}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15325448, "now": "05/10/20(Sun)10:31:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "whats so great about this? its a guy who goes on a walk and thinks about shit. so deep.", "filename": "41Cx7BKVwRL", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 335, "h": 500, "tn_w": 167, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1589121100826, "time": 1589121100, "md5": "2kLDL8TKX/3HTWt7CmD6FA==", "fsize": 19192, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "whats-so-great-about-this-its-a-guy-who-goes-on-a", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 12, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 7, "omitted_images": 1}, {"no": 15327266, "now": "05/10/20(Sun)14:35:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15327208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15327208</a><br>succinct and in interesting thought anon", "time": 1589135757, "resto": 15325448}, {"no": 15328830, "now": "05/10/20(Sun)17:46:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15325460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15325460</a><br>yeah, and it&#039;s great.
